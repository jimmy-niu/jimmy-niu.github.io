### Portfolio Site, Jimmy Niu, Summer 2018
This site has a light up feature when viewed on a computer. Drag your cursor around to see the effect!

Also try resizing the window and/or using it on mobile! The changes are all achieved using vanilla JS and flexboxes / styling.

Development for more features can be found here: (https://github.com/jimmy-niu/lightboxSite) [https://github.com/jimmy-niu/lightboxSite]

Please feel free to use any of this code! I added an apache license to said repository. 

If you come across a MIT student's portfolio website that looks uncannily similar, I do hope the fellow added a link to the repository I shared them. Oh well.
